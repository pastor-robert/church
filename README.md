# Church Management Suite

## Mission

To glorify God and serve God's church by providing, as either a package or a service, cloud-based IT services.

## Vision

My eventual goal is or this to be a complete IT solution for church management.
It will have tools for:

* tracking membership
* preaching
* creating bulletins
* finances
* etc.

It will also have public-facing components, including

* videos
* blogs
* interactive bulletins
* church directory
* etc.

## Current Reality

* 2023-11-28 The only component we have so far is a churuch directory app.

## Credit

Soli Deo Gloria.
